## Description

This is a program that shows off the creation of a dynamically created

database that consists of users and their thoughts. Users can create 

accounts and post their thoughts. Other users can leave a "reaction"

which is a comment on said thought. Users can also add friends to a

friend's list and delete friend's if necessary

## Usage

The main usage of this program is to show off the creation of routes

and connections between files to show a dynamic database that can then

be added to a website. This teaches us a lot of backend development and 

helps us understand how it works through example

## Status

This program is currently still a work in progress. I could only get

a few of my user routes to fully work. This is shown in the demo video.

I found that the hardest part for me was getting my controllers set up

despite having prior experience.
